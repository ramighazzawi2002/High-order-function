# JavaScript Array Operations

This project contains a collection of JavaScript functions that perform various operations on arrays. The functions are implemented in different ways to demonstrate the usage of different JavaScript methods like `for`, `forEach`, and `map`.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Functions

### Power of Two

The `powerOfTwoUsingFor`, `powerOfTwoUsingForEach`, and `powerOfTwoUsingMap` functions take an array of integers as input and return a new array. The returned array contains the result of raising 2 to the power of the original input element.

### Odd or Even

The `isOddOrEven` function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array where each element is either the string "even" or the string "odd", based on each value. If any element in the array is not a number, the resulting array has the string "N/A" in its place.

### Return All Names

The `returnAllNames` function uses `forEach` to return all the names in an array.

### FizzBuzz

The `fizzBuzz` function takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array based on several rules. If a number is divisible by 3, it adds the word "Fizz" to the output array. If the number is divisible by 5, it adds the word "Buzz" to the output array. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it adds the phrase "Fizz Buzz" to the output array. Otherwise, it adds the number to the output array.

## Running the Project

To run the project, open the `index.html` file in your browser. The JavaScript code in `script.js` will be executed.
